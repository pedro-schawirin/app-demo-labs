# E-commerce Sanity Stripe

Welcome to the E-commerce Sanity Stripe app! This app is built using Next.js and is currently configured with Next.js version 12.x. It is a robust e-commerce platform that includes integration with Stripe for payment processing and Datadog for real-time monitoring and analytics.

## Features

- **Docker Support**: The app includes both a Dockerfile for local development and a Kubernetes manifest file (YAML) for deployment in Kubernetes environments, ensuring easy and consistent setups.
- **Stripe Integration**: Uses Stripe in development mode for handling payments. To switch to a production setup, replace the Stripe API keys located in the environment variables.
- **Datadog Integration**: The app is integrated with Datadog's monitoring services, capturing logs and metrics, especially focusing on transaction data to showcase SIEM capabilities using simulated fraudulent card transactions.
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Instrumented with Datadog's RUM within the app.js to monitor and analyze user interactions in real-time.

## Setup

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v14.x or higher recommended)
- Yarn package manager
- Docker (if running inside containers)
- Kubernetes (optional, for deployment using YAML manifest)
- Stripe account (for payment API access)
- Datadog account (for monitoring)

### Running the App Locally

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

2. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

3. **Build the app for production**:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Docker and Kubernetes

- **Docker**:

    ```bash
    docker build -t ecommerce-sanity-stripe .
    docker run -p 3000:3000 ecommerce-sanity-stripe
    ```

- **Kubernetes**:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ecomerce.yaml
    ```

### Updating Stripe Credentials

Update the `.env` file with your Stripe API keys to switch to production mode or modify the keys for different environments.

### Example Fraudulent Transactions

To demonstrate the SIEM capabilities, use the following test card numbers provided by Stripe for fraudulent transactions:

- **Generic Decline**: 4000000000000002
- **Insufficient Funds**: 4000000000009995
- **Lost Card**: 4000000000009987
- **Stolen Card**: 4000000000009979
- **Incorrect CVC**: 4000000000000127

These examples can be used to trigger specific decline behaviors in your payment processing to test how the system handles various failure scenarios.
